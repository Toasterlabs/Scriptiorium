# Scriptiorium
Over the years I wrote a lot of stuff. Some good, some bad, some really bad. But hey! Don't we all :)
I've decided to rewrite what's necessary, and store it all centrally in this repository... Yes, there will be functions I haven't written myself, but credit will be given to those that wrote it...

There are 2 different main folders:
 
 * GrandSharedModule
 Simply put, the central location for every function that I worked on/with.
 * Scripts
 Scripts I wrote, or reworked...
 
 ## Grand Shared Module
* [Console and Logging](https://github.com/Toasterlabs/Scriptiorium/blob/master/GrandSharedModule/Public/Console%20and%20Logging/readme.md)
